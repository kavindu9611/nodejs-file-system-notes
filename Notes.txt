Async Iterators

An iterator is like a list you can go through one item at a time.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
for (const number of numbers) {
    console.log(number); // prints 1, then 2, then 3, then 4
}

An async iterator is the same thing, but each item might take 
time to arrive (like waiting for mail). Instead of having all items 
ready immediately, they come one by one over time.

// Regular loop (all items ready now)
for (const item of regularList) { }

// Async loop (items arrive over time)
for await (const item of asyncList) { }

What is encoder and decoder

decoder ----> convert 01(zeroes and ones) to something meaningful
encoder ----> convert meaningful things to 01(zeroes and ones) 

Nodejs only understands character decoder and character encoder
It doesnt understand image encoder and video decoder
