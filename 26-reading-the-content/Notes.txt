When we want to read a file
First we have to open it
And then once the file is opened, you could either read from that file or you could write to that file
or append to it, or get the status of that file.
By status I mean that file data.
For example, you want to see when that file was last modified.

Now what really happens when you open a file is that you are you're not actually moving the whole contents
of that file to your memory.
What happens is that you are just saving a number regarding that file.
It's called a file descriptor.

file descriptor - is just a number that has been assigned to an opened file
                  each open file has a unique file descriptor

<FileHandle> objects are <EventEmitter>s
This means FileHandle object is inheriting from EventEmitter object
